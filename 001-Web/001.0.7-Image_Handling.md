Want fast loading web pages?

You probably arenâ€™t optimizing your images enough. Image optimization is frequently overlooked because itâ€™s only a small difference and takes some time to do, but a series of small changes will lead to a screaming fast website. Itâ€™s worth it. Your pages will load faster.

### Why Does This Matter?

- Itâ€™s better for your user.
- It makes your page more accessible in low bandwidth situations.
- Itâ€™s better for SEO.
- 
All this in exchange for a few minutes of your time. Do you need any more reasons to optimize your images?

### What Weâ€™ll Do

In this article, I will show you four ways to optimize your images and the results from each of them. Iâ€™ll explain how I tested them and show you the results.

You can download the files and perform your own tests by downloading this repo. Feel free to play around with it.

For testing, I decided to grab random images from *Unsplash*. I randomized the width and height to get various dimensions you might see on the web.

I used this script to pull down 32 images and put them into a folder.

**Weâ€™re going to look at:**
- The raw files (with nothing done to them)
- Photoshop optimizing
- RIOT optimizing
- XNConvert JPEG optimizing
- XNConvert to Webp optimizing
- 
Weâ€™ll also see how these methods stack up. We will examine file size and page load time. As a note, I do not change the resolution or color depth of these images, so they are all the same except for the optimizations.

### How Iâ€™m Testing Load Time
   
Iâ€™m testing load time by creating a simple *index.html* file in each folder that loads up a table of the images. 
I am serving it up with the [NPM serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) package because itâ€™s a simple HTML server that runs locally. 
I donâ€™t want network latency to affect the results.

Then I use CURL to grab the load time:
```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{time_total}\n" -H "Pragma: no-cache" https://localhost:3000
```

Letâ€™s optimize some images and see the results.

### Raw Images
This is a test with the images straight from Unsplash. It is our baseline measurement.

Here is the total file size for all images:

![[Resources/Pasted image 20211217164906.png]]

So weâ€™re starting with 3.1MB of images. Not too shabby, but not small either.
Here is the page load time:

![[Resources/Pasted image 20211217164955.png]]

I ran the test ten times and got an average load time of 0.0013495 seconds. It seems fast, but we can improve on it.

### Optimized With Photoshop
For the next set of images, I optimized these with Photoshop. I used the following settings:

![[Resources/PhotoShopImage 20211217165109.png]]

I set a quality of 60 and set it to progressive with no metadata. I got some interesting results.

Here is the total file size for all images:
![[Resources/Pasted image 20211217190417.png]]

Itâ€™s **3.3MB**, which is more than we started with. I have no idea why this is and will investigate and update later. But most of the time, this creates smaller images.

Here is the page load time:

![[Resources/Pasted image 20211217190508.png]]

Our average load time is 0.001213 seconds, which is a little above the raw files. Not much of a surprise with this file size.

### Optimized With RIOT
Next, I optimized the images with the *Radical Image Optimization Tool (RIOT)*. This is only available in Windows, but itâ€™s an excellent tool Iâ€™ve been using for years.

I used the following settings:
![[Resources/Pasted image 20211217190629.png]]


And even though I left the quality pretty high at 82%, it shrunk the files down considerably:

![[Resources/Pasted image 20211217190700.png]]

Here is the total file size for all images:

![[Resources/Pasted image 20211217190731.png]]

At **2.3MB**, thatâ€™s quite a bit of savings. This reduces your websiteâ€™s footprint without sacrificing quality.

Here is the page load time:
![[Resources/Pasted image 20211217190804.png]]

Our average load time is** 0.0010877 seconds**, which is our fastest yet.

### Optimized With XNConvert (JPG)

For this test, I optimized the images with XNConvert and used it to optimize the JPEGs. This is the tool I use the most because it runs in Windows, Mac, or Linux and does batch processing quickly.

![[Resources/Pasted image 20211217190857.png]]

I removed the metadata:

![[Resources/Pasted image 20211217190919.png]]

Then saved them with the following settings:

![[Resources/Pasted image 20211217190944.png]]

Here is the total file size for all images:
![[Resources/Pasted image 20211217191007.png]]

At **2.2MB**, this is the smallest weâ€™ve seen yet. However, I donâ€™t expect it will significantly improve load time over the previous 2.3MB of images.

Here is the page load time:
![[Resources/Pasted image 20211217191032.png]]

   

The average is **0.001085 seconds**, which is a little faster than RIOT. Great!

==I highly recommend XNConvert for image optimization==. 
But, we can take this even a step further and convert everything to Webp images. 

These will be significantly smaller and hopefully faster.

### Optimized With XNConvert (WebP)
So I took the same set of raw images and converted them to .webp images. This is Googleâ€™s recommended image format these days, and itâ€™s easy to see why.

Here are the settings I used:

Here is the total file size for all images:

Wow! We went from **3.1MB** of images to **1.5MB**. Thatâ€™s significant. Letâ€™s see what it does to load time.

The average is** 0.0010326 seconds**, which is a new record. Great!

This is something you should consider when doing image optimization on your site. WebP images are the way forward.

### Letâ€™s Look at the Results!

This is the total file size for all images:

| Method               | File Size |
| -------------------- | --------- |
| Raw images           | 3.1MB     |
| Photoshop            | 3.3MB     |
| RIOT                 | 2.3MB     |
| XNConvert (JPG)      | 2.2MB     |
| ==XNConvert (Webp)== | ==1.5MB== | 

| Method               | Load Time     |
| -------------------- | ------------- |
| Raw images           | 0.0013495     |
| Photoshop            | 0.001213      |
| RIOT                 | 0.0010877     |
| XNConvert (JPG)      | 0.00108       |
| ==XNConvert (Webp)== | ==0.0010326== | 

### Conclusion
Optimize your images! As you can see, it makes a difference, even with this small page with 32 images on it. I will do this experiment again with a larger image set to see how the changes scale.

Overall itâ€™s pretty clear that .webp images are smaller and more efficient.

Itâ€™s definitely worth the few minutes of extra time.
