# 001.0-1-WebAnatomy_and_MVC_Explained

##   WebForm Anatomy
   
- <Page Directive => how to compile
- <DocType = Type of markup => html, xhtml
- Wenn webpage komisch dann meist ein problem mit doctype
- Andere z.B. Split
- S 111 = 111 minimal webpage xhtml
- Css inline oder file.
- Debug = web.config
- Asp.Net App => App + shared Resource config settings
- Virtual Dir in IIS
- One ASP Net App == one AppDomain S 130 / precompile S 318
- .asax
- ! Jedes asp = cached automatisch ggf ausschalten
- ! Web PageEvents haben keine Events wie in C# sondern sind einfache Methoden. S 144
- Server.Transfer = zu neuer Seite ohne das User es bemerkt, der sieht nur original aufruf
- Bzw. Response.Redirect Websitename.
- ! Server HTML.Encode = ("< ‚Ä¶ >") => wird in Syntaktisch richtiges HTML umgewandelt.
-   App Events sind in Datei Global.asax
-   Maschine.config -> root web.config -> WeppApp web.config -> Seite web.config
-   HTML Server Controls
-   Only 2 events
-   Trigger postback
-   Server changed sind beide JSCRIPT
-   ASP.Net 2 hiddenfields
-   Event Target
-   Event Argument
-   GridView
-   Template Field
-   Command Name / Command Argument

‚≠ê TryUpdateModel => ModelBinding => Get DataValues from browser Request and populate properties of datamodel.
==! Vorraussetzung daf√ºr ist => runat="server"??

z.B:
```CSharp
 if (this.TryUpdateModel(myOrder, new FormValueProvider(ModelBindingExecutionContext)));
```

##   Validation
Attributes -> [Required] on data Classes ! + <asp:ValidationSummary ‚Ä¶. />
‚≠ê  IsPostBack

## Beschreibung
_Auszug aus Buch_

In the MVC pattern, the data itself is encapsulated in a model object. The view object is the Windows Forms control that the data is bound to. All changes to the model are handled by an intermediary controller object, which is responsible for providing access to the data and for controlling any changes made to the data through the view object. The controller object provides a natural location for validating changes made to the data, and all user interface validation logic should be implemented here.

Figure 2.5 depicts the structural relationship between the three objects in the MVC pattern.

Figure 2.5¬†¬†¬†Objects in Model-View-Controller pattern

Using a controller object in this way has a number of advantages. You can configure a generic controller to provide custom validation rules, which are configurable at run time according to some contextual information (for example, the role of the user). Alternatively, you can provide a number of controller objects, with each controller object implementing specific validation rules, and then select the appropriate object at run time. Either way, because all validation logic is encapsulated in the controller object, the view and model objects do not need to change.

In addition to separating data, validation logic, and user interface controls, the MVC model gives you a simple way to automatically update the user interface when the underlying data changes. The controller object is responsible for notifying the user interface when changes to the data have occurred by some other programmatic means. Windows Forms data binding listens for events generated by the objects that are bound to the controls so that the user interface can automatically respond to changes made to the underlying data.

To implement automatic updates of the user interface, you should ensure that the controller implements a change notification event for each property that may change. Events should follow the naming convention < property>Changed, where < property> is the name of the property. For example, if the controller supports a Name property, it should also support a NameChanged event. If the value of the name property changes, this event should be fired so Windows Forms data binding can handle it and update the user interface.

The following code example defines a Customer object, which implements a Name property. The CustomerController object handles the validation logic for a Customer object and supports a Name property, which in turn represents the Name property on the underlying Customer object. This controller fires an event whenever the name is changed.

   
```csharp
public class Customer  
{  
 private string _name;  
 public Customer( string name ) { _name = name; }  
 public string Name  
 {  
 get { return _name; }  
 set { _name = value; }  
 }  
}  
public class CustomerController  
{  
 private Customer _customer = null;  
 public event EventHandler NameChanged;  
 public Customer( Customer customer )  
 {  
 this._customer = customer;  
 }  
 public string Name  
 {  
 get { return _customer.Name; }  
 set  
 {  
 	// TODO: Validate new name to make sure it is valid.  
 	_customer.Name = value;  
 	// Notify bound control of change.  
 	if ( NameChanged != null )  
 		NameChanged( this, EventArgs.Empty );  	
 }  
 }  
}
```

```ad-info 
Note Customer data source members need to be initialized when they are declared. In the preceding example, the customer.Name member needs to be initialized to an empty string. This is because the .NET Framework does not have a chance to interact with the object and set the default setting of an empty string before the data binding occurs. If the customer data source member is not initialized, the attempt to retrieve a value from an uninitialized variable causes a run-time exception.
```

In the following code example, the form has a TextBox object, textbox1, which needs to be bound to the customer's name. The code binds the Text property of the TextBox object to the Name property of the controller.

```csharp
_customer = new Customer( "Kelly Blue" );  
_controller = new CustomerController( _customer );  
Binding binding = new Binding( "Text", _controller, "Name" );  
textBox1.DataBindings.Add( binding );
```

If the name of the customer is changed (using the Name property on the controller), the NameChanged event is fired and the text box is automatically updated to reflect the new name value.
