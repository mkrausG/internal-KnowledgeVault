Multirelease JAR functionality is one of the main features.. But we do not need to use it but we need to ensure that the old code still runs = Konfiguration for it. (export ... Module...)

- Deprecation
- Removed
	- Corba and Java EE Modules were removed 


## Upgrade to Spring 6
### Big Points
- Spring Framework introduces core abstractions
- Portfolio projects consistently integrate with htem
- Spring Boot provides auto-configuration

### Native executables

Native Compilation with GraalVM gets a higher priority.

For AOT generation just use `mvn spring-boot:aot-generate` without seperate plugings.

### Observability 

was:
- Spring Cloud Sleuth 
- Spring Cloud 
- Spring boot
- Spring Framework 
- Micrometer

Now:

- Spring Cloud 
- Spring boot
- Spring Framework 
- Micrometer (includes now tracing)


Code:
```java
// Beispiel Observability 
```

### Changes Spring Web MVC

- HttpMethods are no longer an enum, now use `HttpMethod lock = HttoMethod.valueOf("LOCK")`
- Outdated servlet based integrations are dropped
	- Commons Fileupload, now use `StandardServletMultipartResolver` instead
	- Tiles
	- Freemarker JSP support, now use FreeMarker templates views instead.
